# Stock-Market-Analysis

Stock Market Analysis and Prediction:

A certain financial planning company wants to upgrade there business model. 
This time they don't want to rely on human intuition to do the analysis and come up with a solution, it takes time and the technology that they are using does not upgrade itself to the current situation rather it works upon the previous learned data which make the prediction very feeble, due to this reason the company is going through a big loss.  

<b/>Aim:  

* Build a new business model which relies not on human intuition. 
* Build a system which can correct itself and being less prone to error Build an accurate system where the indicators are accurate enough to analyze and predict correctly.
* Build a system that is fast and reliable.
